# Hiatus
Hello everybody!

It's omoso, again. You actually haven't heard from me for awhile now, as I have left the Legacy4J discord server due to personal reasons I will not delve into.
As of today, both Devin and me have decided to put Re-Console onto an **indefinite hiatus.**

## What does this mean?
Re-Console will no longer be actively maintained for the time being.
It will be in a playable and stable state, ensuring that the modpack will at least function. Any reported issues **will not** be fixed during this time.

I will also follow up on [The Future of Re-Console](https://l4j.novassite.net/?blogpost=The%20Future%20of%20Re-Console) blogpost made earlier in the year; 

**I may not be returning to Re-Console development.** My personal wishes are to no longer be directly involved with Legacy4J as a project as of now. This may change at a later point though.
I have also decided to take a step back from Minecraft as a whole for the time being, however you can still follow some of my other projects on Modrinth as they will most likely receive occasional updates.

## How long will this last?
It is indefinite. It may be a month, two, three, and so on and so on. There is no set time of when or if Re-Console will return, if it does, it will simply begin recieving updates again once the hiatus is over.

I appreciate your support for Re-Console, thank you for reading.
